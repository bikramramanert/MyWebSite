		The Stupa at Sanchi, is one of the oldest existing Buddhist stupas in India,
<br>
		and part of the Buddhist complex of Sanchi in Madhya Pradesh. It is of particular 
 <br>
		interest since it has the earliest known important displays of decorative reliefs
<br>
		in India, probably anterior to the reliefs at the Mahabodhi Temple in Bodh Gaya, or
<br>
		the reliefs of Bharhut. It displays what has been called the oldest extensive stupa 
 <br>
		decoration in existence.Stupa at Sanchi is therefore considered as the birthplace of
<br>
		Jataka illustrations.<a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanchi_Stupa_No._2"> Click here for more details</a>  </td>

				The Taj Mahal known as 'Crown of the Palace', is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on
<br>
				the southern bank of the river Yamuna in the Indian city of Agra. It was commissioned
<br>
				in 1632 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan (reigned from 1628 to 1658) to house the tomb 
 <br>
				of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. 
 <br>
				The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare complex, which includes a mosque and a guest
<br>
				house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.
<br>
				Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but work continued on other 
<br>
				phases of the project for another 10 years. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been
<br>
				completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around 32 million rupees, 
 <br>
				which in 2020 would be approximately 70 billion rupees. The construction project employed some
<br>
				20,000 artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by the court architect to the emperor
 <br>
				, Ustad Ahmad Lahauri. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taj_Mahal"> Click here for more details.</a>
